        As the lead programmer for this project, I had many miscellaneous tasks and responsibilities. Some highlights
        include writing a project style-guide for the entire team, delegating tasks, and getting developers to agree on
        the project's direction. During meetings with the leads and producer, it was always appreciated that I could explain goals and
        limitations in a non-technical way and give proper estimates on discussed goals.

        During the project, we intended to use quite a lot of animations, but it would take too much time for the two
        animators on our team to create all of them. With 3 weeks left on the project, I volunteered to start working on
        procedural movement animations. With absolutely zero experience in animation or procedural animation, it would be
        a challenge to learn and implement it in the game in such a short time.

    {{ _self.paragraph("
        After researching and seeing how other people online created procedural animations in Unreal Engine's Control Rig
        Editor, I started working on my version based on one of the resources found online. In their version of the control
        rig, the legs of their spider model would reset to their reference position based on a timer. This worked great if
        the spider was always moving at a slow and constant speed, but if the enemy were to move a bit faster, the legs
        would drag after the crab model we had.
    ") }}
    {{ _self.paragraph("
        My solution was to create a system in which the legs moved within a predetermined range so that no matter how fast
        the crab moved, it would always look correct and move only when needed. If one leg was too far in front, move it to
        the back and vice versa.

        With the procedural animation working as intended, it was time to start blending the procedural animation with the
        hand-made animations the artist had worked on. The artist animated multiple idle and attack animations, which would make the
        crab feel a lot more alive, while the procedural animation would always look proper, no matter the terrain it would walk on.
